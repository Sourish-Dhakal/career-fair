            <p class="index_Section_1_Info_Variant_1_Section_Paragraph">Web Developer is an information based job. It handles information and organizes/sending it. When you’re a web developer, you have to make a website look good and have information. The website has to complete it’s purpose and it usuallY does that by managing some information and storing it in some big database. The entire use of the internet is to get information around easier and the web developer does it in a way that makes it easy for people to get and pleasing to the eye. For example, a gaming website has to share the files of the game. Information sent. Wikipedia is all about sending information to others. Web developers also have to make it pleasing. They have to get a arts degree because an appealing website will always get more views that one that doesn't look good. The hardest thinga bout making a website is not the coding part, it's knowing how to make it pleasing to the eye.

            <p class="index_Section_1_Info_Variant_2_Section_Paragraph">
                The web develoPer builds websites that their clients/company want. For example, if someone wanted a website for a video game, Web developErs are the people  for the job. They have to be able to aDapt to what the client wants, because sometimes they want to process payments and sometimes they want a super cool looking gaming website. Some companys want websites but they don't know how to code and make websites so they hire a web developer. They do many things, like make account systems, make the website look good, create the small things that mean a lot. They also make things more secure, imagine a bank website that wasn't secure.

            <p class="index_Section_1_Info_Variant_1_Section_Paragraph">Because there are 100% no external factors that could stop your thing from working. If there’s a bug in your code, it’s 100% your fault and it’s 100% fixAble. Your code can also eventually run a very high profile website! It’s also a job where you barely need to be helped by other people, most of the time, google is your friend! BeiNg a web developer is a cool job. There's many memes about programmers using code from online to create things. But it's the best way to learn how to code.

You might have to make an entire website, so it's important that you have mastered all these skills. Bad things could happen if you don't get the deadline, but this is true for all jobs.

So you can try to make it so good that you get a very good reputation and are sent on more projects. It's also pretty annoying to be asked what to add on the website every other second, and it'll make you look better if you can just understand what the website needs.

I've mentioned that you might have to work alone a lot but that's half of the truth. You also have to work with more web developers. It means you don't have to work as hard and it makes your code more organized. You can learn from them and they can learn from you. Two heads are better than one. It can bring up clarity in your work when people work together. Also some people are front-end developers and don't know how to work with databases and so they need other back-end developers.

                Sometimes, you’re working with other people and if you want them to understand your code. You’re going to need to be very VERY organized. Coding can be a complicated thing, as a programmer you need to make sure it’s easier for others. This image is an example of organization. Me and Kiran both built this website from ground up. All the code was made by us and this is how we made sure it was all organized. I did most of the the front-end (What you see) and he did most of the back-end and API (storing information in an external database). This is how we made sure that we were on the same page. </p>

                Web developers must sit at a computer and write detailed code for long periods. Writing code can be complicated and if you keep losing focus then how will you make sure your code is bug free? Whenever I come back to my code after some time, I wonder what I was thinking. But the website did manage to work, I was focused in that time and managed to make it work. But if I wasn't focused when working on it, I would never get a small thing done. There's a million things to do to get a small thing to work, you shouldn't be putting your mind everywhere all at once.</p>

            <p class="index_Section_1_Info_Variant_1_Section_Paragraph">
            Web developers are often involved in designing the appearance of a website and must make sure that it looks innovative and up to date. Creativity mostly appears when you create a website to make it look good and to make the ways you do things as efficent as possible. When you code anything, efficiency is very important when coding. There can be like 80 different ways to do the same thing, but sometimes all 80 aren't the way you want to do it. It takes creativity to create the 81st way. Every new way does things differently and every new coding assignment needs a new way of doing the same thing. It also takes creativity to create an appealing and innovative website. Imagine somebody who struggles with creativity trying to draw, it's hard. What do you draw about? The same goes with designing a webpage. It takes creativity to have a plan beforehand and putting it into code.</p>

            Web developers have to respond politely and correctly to user questions and requests. Imagine if the person making your website wasn't nice. What if you wanted to make a change to the website, it would be difficult to ask him because he wasn't nice. You might not be called to make another website again. Sometimes the website you made has a bunch of bugs and you need to go fix it, and nobody wants you to be mean about it. Being a web developer probably sounds like a job where you don't need to be around people but in any job people will be involved, it's important that you're nice and approachable. You might also be involved in making sure the website is up and running and there is no issue in the website, and if there is your job might be to fix it. If somebody reaches out to you, you have to be polite to make sure that you're still good. This is not only in web developer, but in any job.</p>

            When web developers write in Javascript, a minor error could cause an entire webpage to stop working. You have no idea how many times my code was ruined because I forgot to put a capital letter in my code. It's crazy, code is case-sensitive meaning if you want to call something later, you must use the same capital letters and lowercase letters. Even one small mistake can mess up the code and cause an error. Programming can really make you go insane when it won't work because of one small thing. This is true for all programming languages.</p>
